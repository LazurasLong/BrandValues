                            <div class="h4 m-b purple">Why are we running a brand values competition?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">Following the local brand activation sessions we wanted to create some fun and excitement bank-wide about the next stage in our brand journey. The brand values we’ve created our a balance between the things we’re good at doing already and things we aspire to be. The competition is here to celebrate the things we already do well!</p>
                            
                            <div class="h4 m-b purple">Why are the brand values so important?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">A companies brand values act as a guiding compass for everything they do internally – when making decisions and when designing things. We have them to ensure we’re aligned in the way we do things otherwise the brand experience for customers will be different everywhere you go – we need a strong brand with a strong understanding of what we stand for.</p>
                            
                            <div class="h4 m-b purple">Who is the competition for?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">Everyone in AIB. Whether you’re in Cork, Uxbridge, Belfast or New York any AIB employees or contractors can take part – the more the merrier.</p>
                            
                            <div class="h4 m-b purple">How long is the competition open for?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">The competition is open for 6 weeks between 27 August and 8 October.</p>
                            
                            <div class="h4 m-b purple">I missed my brand activation session - can I take part still?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">Yes of course. It’s important you try and go to a ‘mop up’ brand activation session. If you can’t or you’ve missed them all, ask your leader or someone in your team to run through it with you – it’s important you understand it. We have a toolkit of activation materials you can also view.</p>

                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">Yes of course, you won’t get more ‘points’ for demonstrating more as we’re looking for quality rather than quality but if it demonstrates more than one value tell us about it.

                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">You can access the competition site at work, on a mobile device (that you can access the internet on) or at home. All you need is your log on details and you can access it anywhere, anytime.</p>

                            <div class="h4 m-b text-success">How can we enter by film when AIB doesn’t have video functionality?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">Unfortunately we don’t have functionality for film internally at the moment – we will do in the future with the improvements that project Edge will bring – but as you can access the site at home or on a mobile device you can enter by film and watch others films that way.</p>

                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">Yes but only once.</p>

                            <div class="h4 m-b text-success">What are you using the poll responses for?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">The polls are there as we’re interested to know what you think about our values and the activation sessions and we hope they will help you to interact with the site.</p>

                            <div class="h4 m-b text-success">We’re not allowed mobile devices at our desks – when can I get involved?</div>

                            <div class="h4 m-b text-success">How long does my entry stay on-line for after the competition closes?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">We’ll keep the entries up on the site for 4 weeks after the competition closes and then we will take them off the site and store them in an archive.</p>

                            <div class="h4 m-b text-success">Can other people outside AIB access this site?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">No absolutely not. We’ve password protected the site to ensure only AIB employees can access the site. We had to use an external website in order to build something as fun and impressive as we could.</p>

                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">No - we want to keep the suspense going throughout the whole competition so you won’t know until the winners are announced on 27 October.</p>
                            
                            <div class="h4 m-b text-warning">What are the prizes going to be?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">There’s a page on winners on the site so do take a look. The individual winner will get a top of the range Apple iPad and the team prize will be a team experience of their choice.</p>
                            
                            <div class="h4 m-b text-warning">What will happen to the winners entries after the competition?</div>
                            <p class="m-b-lg text-muted">We want to use them as brand collateral in the offices to inspire others to live the values. And we’ll of course keep all the entries in an AIB archive to use for other opportunities.</p>
